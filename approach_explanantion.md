# Document Intelligence System - Technical Approach

## System Overview

This document intelligence system processes PDF collections and extracts relevant content based on user personas and specific job requirements. The system handles multiple document types including travel guides, technical tutorials, and recipe collections.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Document Analysis Engine

The system provides robust PDF processing capabilities:

- **Text Extraction**: Uses PyMuPDF for comprehensive PDF text extraction with page-level granularity
- **Section Detection**: Implements pattern-based header recognition using regex patterns for titles, numbered sections, and structural elements
- **Content Validation**: Filters and validates extracted sections based on length, coherence, and structural integrity
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure management for corrupted or inaccessible PDF files

### 2. Persona Analysis Engine

The core intelligence component that understands user context:

- **Persona Classification**: Automatically identifies persona types (Travel Planner, HR Professional, Food Contractor) from role descriptions
- **Keyword Matching**: Maintains specialized vocabularies for each persona category
- **Context Integration**: Analyzes job-to-be-done descriptions to enhance relevance scoring
- **Scoring Algorithm**: Combines persona-specific and task-specific relevance with configurable weights

### 3. Content Ranking System

Advanced algorithmic approach for content prioritization:

- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Evaluates content against both persona keywords and job-specific terminology
- **Frequency-based Scoring**: Calculates keyword density while normalizing for content length
- **Relevance Differentiation**: Uses scoring amplification to create clear relevance distinctions
- **Bounded Output**: Caps relevance scores at 1.0 for consistent comparison

## Technical Implementation

### Processing Workflow

1. **Configuration Loading**: Parses input JSON files for each collection
2. **Document Processing**: Processes all PDFs in collection-specific directories
3. **Section Analysis**: Applies persona-aware analysis to each document section
4. **Content Ranking**: Sorts content by calculated relevance scores
5. **Output Generation**: Creates structured JSON with top 15 most relevant sections

### Performance Optimizations

- **Streaming Processing**: Handles large document collections without memory overflow
- **Content Limiting**: Truncates section content to 1000 characters for output efficiency
- **Early Filtering**: Removes low-quality sections before expensive scoring operations
- **Batch Processing**: Efficiently processes multiple collections in sequence

## Persona-Specific Processing

### Travel Planner Persona

- **Keywords**: destination, itinerary, accommodation, restaurant, attraction, activity, budget, transportation, booking, schedule, group, hotel, tourism, sightseeing, culture, history, local, travel, trip, vacation, guide, tourist, city, cuisine
- **Focus Areas**: Group planning, budget considerations, local experiences, cultural insights

### HR Professional Persona

- **Keywords**: form, document, compliance, onboarding, employee, policy, signature, workflow, process, digital, fillable, field, data, collection, management, automation, electronic, pdf, create, convert, edit, export, fill, sign
- **Focus Areas**: Digital workflows, form creation, compliance management, automation

### Food Contractor Persona

- **Keywords**: recipe, ingredient, cooking, preparation, menu, dish, vegetarian, buffet, serving, nutrition, meal, kitchen, catering, corporate, dinner, food, cuisine, dietary, breakfast, lunch, restaurant, chef
- **Focus Areas**: Menu planning, dietary restrictions, corporate catering, buffet-style serving

## Key Features

- **Context-Aware Processing**: Adapts analysis approach based on document collection characteristics
- **Multi-Collection Support**: Handles diverse document types with tailored processing strategies
- **Scalable Architecture**: CPU-only design suitable for production deployment
- **Comprehensive Output**: Provides detailed metadata, processing statistics, and analytical insights

## Quality Assurance

- **Schema Compliance**: Strict adherence to required JSON output format
- **Error Recovery**: Robust handling of missing files and processing failures
- **Performance Monitoring**: Detailed logging and processing statistics
- **Validation Framework**: Built-in checks for output quality and completeness
- **Content Diversification**: Balances relevance with content variety

## System Requirements

- **Python 3.8+**: Required for all processing components
- **Memory**: Minimum 500MB RAM for processing large collections
- **Storage**: Sufficient space for input PDFs and output JSON files
- **Dependencies**: PyMuPDF, jsonschema, and other standard Python libraries

This approach ensures high-quality, persona-specific content extraction while maintaining performance constraints and output format compliance.
